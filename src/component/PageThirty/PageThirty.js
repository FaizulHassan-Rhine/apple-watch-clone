It activates automatically when you submerge and shows the time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and maximum depth youâ€™ve reached. It also shows a dive summary on your watch, and saves a log of each session in the Fitness app on your iPhone. This gives you a complete history of your dives, including a graph of the dive and a map showing the GPS entry point.</p>
